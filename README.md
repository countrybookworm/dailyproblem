This site contains problems that I gave to my kids daily.  I usually give them about an hour to solve the problem.

The goal of these exercises is for my kids to learn how to think.  The solutions themselves do not matter much.  However, I would like to see if they could eventually grasp the concept of learning to think by understanding why they were on the wrong path.  For the types of problems they struggled with, I would usually repeat a few times until they get it.  When they struggled for a few days in a row, I would give them easier ones to relax a bit.

Most problems require at least 3rd grade math.

Some problems are from internet.  In such cases, I will mentioned the source.  If the source is not exactly available, I would mention that it is not my own.

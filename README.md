This site contains problems that I gave to my kids daily.  I usually give them about an hour to solve the problem.

The difficulties of the problems are uneven.  Some days are pretty easy, while some days are very difficult.  Most problems require at least 3rd grade math.

Some problems are from internet.  In such cases, I will mentioned the source.  If the source is not exactly available, I would mention that it is not my own.
